## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.0+
- Android device with USB debugging
- Server running (see backend setup)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on device
flutter run
```

### Configuration

1. **Server IP**: Tap settings icon on home screen
2. **Update API URL**: Enter your server IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8000`)
3. **Test Connection**: App will verify server status

### Usage

1. **Launch app** → Check server status
2. **Start Measurement** → Opens camera
3. **Position object** → Follow on-screen instructions
4. **Auto-capture** → Walk slowly around object
5. **Wait for processing** → 60-90 seconds
6. **View results** → Measurements with confidence

## Image Capture Guidelines

### For Best Accuracy:
- 📸 **20 images** (auto-captured in 30 seconds)
- 🔄 **Complete 360° circle** around object
- 📏 **Maintain consistent distance** (50-70cm)
- 💡 **Good lighting** (no harsh shadows)
- 🎯 **70-80% overlap** between images
- 📱 **Hold steady** during capture

### What to Avoid:
- ❌ Moving too fast
- ❌ Changing distance
- ❌ Dim lighting
- ❌ Reflective objects
- ❌ Cluttered background

## Expected Results

### Before Calibration:
- Accuracy: ±5-15%
- Confidence: 20-40%

### After Calibration:
- Accuracy: ±2-5%
- Confidence: 60-80%

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server"
- Check WiFi connection
- Verify server IP in settings
- Ensure server is running
- Check firewall (port 8000)

### "Camera permission denied"
- Go to Settings → Apps → Measurement App → Permissions
- Enable Camera permission

### "Low confidence results"
- Recapture with better lighting
- Ensure full 360° coverage
- Use manual calibration
